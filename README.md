# Space-Shooter. My first Videogame

This is the first videogame I developed in cooperation with two classmates. We had very few time to do it (two months) without knowledge, but we succeeded. The process was one of my favourite experiences in my life.
I won't clean all the scenes and different items that are not used because I prefer to remember it as it is. Maybe in a while I decide to create a 2nd improved version.

Very proud of it.
